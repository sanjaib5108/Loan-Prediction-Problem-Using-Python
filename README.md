# Loan-Prediction-Problem-Using-Python

# Project Description
Loan Prediction Problem Using Python is a Project to examine the trends of a loan application is acceptance criteria using Python.

# Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the variables impact on the staus of the loan application. It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In these kinds of problems, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variables.

# Methods Used
- Data Extraction
- Data Transformation
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

# Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel 
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn Libraries.

# Dataset
Dataset has been imported from the Kaggle Data Libray for analysis purpose. Dataset has 614 Rows and 13 Columns in Train Dataset
and 367 rows and 12 columns in Test Dataset.

# Project Description
This project has been done as part of my Training in Data Analytics using Python. The datset has been imported from Kaggle Datasets and has been transformed and visualized for the easy understanding. The project deals with loan application and the chances of being approved or not. Loans are the major requirement in the world. When it comes to deciding whether the applicantâ€™s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects. Using Machine Learning with Python to ease the work of banks and predict whether the applicant's profile is relevant or not using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc. from the dataset. I have used Exploratory Data Analysis using Univariate Analysis, BiVariate Analysis in EDA, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree methods in Model Building of Machine Learning with Python.
